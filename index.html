            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">I use yarn to create textile art and accessories by weaving and knitting.
               I've made a lot of
               different products, including wall hangings, throw pillows, blankets, hats, scarves &amp; face
               masks.
               You can follow a ball of yellow yarn through four of my projects.</p>

            <h3>Woven Wall Hanging</h3>
            <p>
               This is the first project where I used the yellow yarn. I used a small tapestry loom to make
               this wall hanging that was inspired by a Mexican
               textile that I saw in an antique store. I love tapestry weaving because you can easily
               create different shapes and textures using different colors and types of yarn. I decided to
               learn how to weave after seeing beautiful Peruvian textiles at the Brooklyn Museum. It is my dream
               to travel to Peru and visit one of the few <a

                  target="_blank">weaving communities</a> that still exist there.

            <h3>Woven Textile for a Pillow</h3>
            <p>
               My second project with the yarn was a woven fabric to make a throw pillow. I used a rigid-heddle loom
               for this project. The benefit of using this kind of loom is that you can make larger pieces of fabric.
               It is also good if you have large parts of repeating patterns. The design for this fabric was inspired by
               a colorful basket
               that I found at an antique store. I like how the yellow color pops alongside the red and grey. I used
               this fabric to make a throw pillow.

            <h3>Knitted Scarf</h3>
            <p>
               For my third project, I knitted a long scarf with blocks of yellow, pink &amp; taupe. I love knitting,
               because it is fascinating to me how many different things you can make out of one strand of yarn. One
               difference between
               knitting and weaving is that you can shape the fabric as you knit, so you don't have to sew pieces
               together. Another difference
               is how long it takes to make something. Weaving is quick, but this scarf took a month to make! One thing
               I really like about knitting is that all you need to know are two basic stitches to be able to make so
               many things. So, even
               beginners can make really cool <a

            <h3>Face Mask</h3>
            <p>
               During quarantine, I made face masks for friends, family, and my <a
                  href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/hellofoxgoods/" target="_blank">etsy shop</a>. I added designs with
               yarn to make them more fun to wear,
               like this one with yellow yarn that says &quot;hello&quot;!
